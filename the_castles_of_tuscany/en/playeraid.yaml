          Play area setup:
          
          1. Assemble the scoring board and place it.
          2. Shuffle the region cards and place them in a stack.
          3. Shuffle the yield cards and place them in a stack.
          4. Sort the square bonus tiles and set them in piles by type.
          5. Place the 8 color bonus tiles with the "1" side face up.
          6. Place the marble, workers, and blue hexagons near the scoring
             board.
          7. Mix the neutral hex tiles (beige back) and set them face down
             in small stacks.

          Each player:

          * 1 player board.
          * Place the double-sided starting castle aside and mix the other
            21 hex tiles in their color.  Create **3 facedown stacks of 7 tiles
            each** and place them on the 3 fields (1. / 2. / 3.) at the top
            of the player board.
          * **Counters**: place the thinner marker on the **50** square of the
            inner scoring bar (red) and the thicker one on the **50** field of
            the outer scoring bar (green).
          * Set aside the 50/100 victory point marker.

          Continue setup:
          
          1. Each player draws 5 region cards.
          2. Each player draws 3 random region boards -- one of each A, B,
             and C -- place them next to each other **long edge to long edge**,
             but **the boards can't be offset by more than 1 hex up or down**.
          3. Each player places their starting castle on one of the 3 dark
             green hexes.
          4. The youngest player is the starting player and they take the
             starting player tile.
          5. All players, in turn order, beginning with the starting player,
             takes any square bonus tile and places it to the right of the 
             corresponding icon on their player board.  **Anyone who takes
             a *+1 storage space* also moves up on the green track 2 spaces**.
          6. Flip 8 of the beige hexes face up in 2 rows of 4

          ![Draw Region Card](/static/img/the_castles_of_tuscany/draw_region.jpg)  **Draw region card**:  Players normally draw 2 region cards, but draw 1
          extra for each bonus tile. **Does not count when playing a 
          Monastery hex**.

          ![Hex Storage Space](/static/img/the_castles_of_tuscany/hex_storage.jpg) **Hex Storage Space**: Place an acquired hex here.  Bonus tiles allow 
          storage of an extra hex.
