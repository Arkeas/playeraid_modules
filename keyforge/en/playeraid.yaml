          1.  Place all the damage tokens, Æmber tokens, and status cards in a
              common supply (if you have them).
          2.  Each player places their identity card in their play area
          3.  Each player places the 3 key tokens, 1 of each color, with the
              unforged side (grey) face up.
          4.  Randomly determine a 1st player.
          5.  Each player shuffles their deck
          6.  The 1st player draws a **hand of 7 cards**.  The other draws a
              **hand of 6 cards**.
          7.  Each player, starting with the 1st player, has 1 opportunity to
              "mulligan" their starting hand by shuffling it back in their
              deck and drawing a new starting hand **with 1 fewer card in it**.

      sections:
          - name: 1. Forge a Key
            text: |
                If the active player has enough Æmber to forge a key, they
                **must** do so.
                
                * **The default cost to forge a key is 6 Æmber**.  Some card
                  abilities may modify this.
                * No more than 1 key can be forged each turn.
          - name: 2. Choose a House
            text: |
                The active player chooses one of their 3 houses to activate,
                making it the **active house** for the turn.  The active house
                determines what cards can be played, discarded or used.
          - name: 3. Play, Discard, and Use Cards of the Chosen House
            text: |
                The active player can play, discard or use any number of cards
                of the **active house** in any order.

                * **1st Turn Rule**: During the 1st player's 1st turn of the
                  game, that player can only play or discard 1 card from their
                  hand.
                * The active player may not play, use, or discard cards of
                  other (non-active) houses unless specified by a card ability.
                * **Æmber Bonus**: Many cards have an Æmber bonus below the
                  house icon.  If the card has this, the 1st thing the player
                  does is gain 1 Æmber per icon.
                * **Play Abilities**: Some cards have a "**Play:**" ability.
                  These resolve after the Æmber bonus is collected (if any) and
                  immediately after the card is played.
                * **Discarding Cards**: The active player can discard from
                  their hand any number of cards from the **active house**.
          - name: 4. Ready Cards
            text: The active player readies each of their exhausted cards
          - name: 5. Draw Cards
            text: |
                The active player draws from their deck until they have **6
                cards** in hand.

                * If the active player has more than 6 cards, they do **not**
                  discard down to 6
                * If a player needs to draw cards (at any time) and cannot
                  because their deck is empty, that player shuffles their
                  discard pile to form a new deck.
                * When a player's turn ends, if that player has enough Æmber in
                  their pool to afford a key, the player announces "Check" so
                  their opponent knows they can forge next turn.
    - name: Card Types
      text: There are 4 types of cards in the game.
      sections:
          - name: Action Cards
            text: |
                When an action card is played, the player resolves the card's
                "**Play:**" ability.  After resolving as much of the ability
                as possible, the card is placed in the discard pile.
          - name: Artifacts
            text: |
                Artifacts enter play exhausted and are placed in a row in
                front of the player, but behind the battle line.  Artifacts
                remain in play from turn to turn.

                There are 2 types of abilities that enable a player to use
                an artifact: "**Action:**" and "**Omni:**" abilities.

                * When a player uses an artifact, they exhaust the card and
                  then resolve its abilities.
                * A player can only resolve an "**Action:**" ability if it is
                  on a card that belongs to the active house.
                * A player can resolve an "**Omni:**" ability **even if it is on
                  a card that does not belong to the active house**.
                * Some artifacts require that they be "sacrificed" as part of
                  the cost of using them.  When an artifact is "sacrificed",
                  it is discarded.  A player must still exhaust such an
                  artifact when using it.
                * Artifacts cannot be used to reap or fight.
          - name: Creatures
            text: |
                Creatures enter play exhausted and are placed in the front row
                of the active player's play area (in front of any artifacts,
                if any).  This row is known as the "battle line".  Creatures
                remain in play from turn to turn.

                When a creature enters play, it must be placed on a flank
                (at the far right or left of the battle line).  When a
                creature leaves play, shift the battle line inward to close
                the gap.
            sections:
                - name: Using Creatures
                  text: |
                      When using a creature, the player exhausts it.  The player
                      has the option to reap, fight, or trigger the creature's
                      "**Action:**" ability.
      
                      * **REAP**: **Any ready creature of the active house may
                        reap**.  When a creature is used for reap, the
                        controller gains 1 Æmber for their pool.  Any
                        "**Reap:**" abilities also resolve.
                      * **FIGHT**: **Any ready creature of the active house may
                        fight**.  When a creature is used to fight, the
                        controller selects a target of the attack.  Each of
                        the 2 creatures deals an amount of damage equal to
                        its power.  **Damage is dealt simultaneously**.  If
                        the attacking creature survives, all "**Fight:**"
                        abilities on the creature activate.
                      * **ACTION**: **Any ready creature of the active house may
                        trigger its "Action:" ability, if it has 1**.  When a
                        creature is used to trigger its "**Action:**" ability,
                        the creature exhausts and all "**Action:" abilities
                        the creature has resolve.
                - name: Damage and Armor
                  text: |
                      When a creature takes damage, place the an amount of
                      damage tokens equal to the damage dealt on the it.
                      If the amount of damage is greater than or equal to
                      the creature's power, it is destroyed and discarded.

                      If the creature has an armor value, the armor prevents
                      that much incoming damage each turn.

                      * When a creature leaves play, any Æmber on that
                        creature is gained by the opponent.
          - name: Upgrades
            text: |
                Upgrades enter play attached to a creature.  Each upgrade
                remains in play from turn to turn continually modifying
                the card it is attached to.

                * If the card to which an upgrade is attached leaves play,
                  the upgrade is discarded.
                * If an upgrade cannot attach to a card in play, the upgrade
                  cannot enter play.
    - name: Card Abilities
      text: |
          When resolving a card ability, resolve as much of the ability as can
          be resolved, and ignore the rest.  Unless otherwise specified, the
          active player makes all decisions while resolving an ability.
      sections:
          - name: Using Cards Via Other Card Abilities
            text: |
                If a card ability allows a player to play/use another card
                (or fight or reap with a card), the chosen card can belong
                to any house unless the ability specifically states otherwise.

                * When using a card via a card ability, any other requirements
                  of using the card must be observed, or the card cannot be
                  used.
                * Players can only use cards they control, unless a card
                  ability states otherwise.
          - name: The Rule of 6
            text: |
                Sometimes a situation will arise when a card may be played or
                used repeatedly during the same turn.  A player cannot play
                and/or use the same card and/or other copies of that card
                (by title) more than **6 times** during a given turn.
          - name: Constant Abilities
            text: |
                If a card has an ability that does not have a bold precursor,
                then the ability is a constant ability that is active while
                the card is in play (and meets any conditions specified on the
                card).
                
                * Constant abilities on a card are active **even while that
                  card is exhausted**.
                * Applying the effects of a constant ability is not considered
                  *using* a card, and therefore, does not cause the card to
                  exhaust.
    - name: Chains
      text: |
          Chains reduce the amount of cards a player can draw.  The chain
          tracker (in the starter set) breaks this down.

          Each time (including during setup) a player with one or more chains
          would draw 1 or more cards to refill their hand, that player draws
          fewer cards (based on their current chain level, below) and then
          reduces the chain counter by 1.

          * **Chains 1-6**: draw 1 fewer card
          * **Chains 7-12**: draw 2 fewer card
          * **Chains 13-18**: draw 3 fewer card
          * **Chains 19-24**: draw 4 fewer card

            id: ability
            text: |
                An ability is the special game text a card adds to the game.
                
                Unless an ability explicitly references an out-of-play area
                (such as the discard), that ability can only interact with
                cards that are in play.
          - name: Action Ability
            id: action_ability
            text: |
                To use an "**Action:**" ability, the active player must
                exhaust the card.  The ability then resolves.
          - name: Active House
            id: active_house
            text: |
                The active house is the house that the active player has
                chosen for the current turn
          - name: Active Player
            id: active_player
            text: |
                The active player is the player taking the current turn.  The
                active player makes all necessary decisions for all card
                abilties or timing conflicts that need to resolve.
          - name: Æmber
            id: ember
            text: |
                Æmber is tracked with Æmber tokens, and is used to forge keys.

          - name: Archives
            id: archives
            text: |
                A player's archives is a facedown game area in front of that
                player's identity card.  Card abilities are the only means
                by which a player is premitted to add cards to their archives.
                During step 2 of a player's turn, after they select an active
                house, the active player can pick up all cards in their
                archives and add those to their hand.

                * Cards in a player's archives are considered out of play.
                * A player may look at their archives at any time.  A player is
                  **not** permitted to look at an opponent's archives.
                * If the ability instructing a player to archive a card does
                  not specify where the card is archived from, the archived card
                  comes from that player's hand.
          - name: Armor
            id: armor
            text: |
                Some creatures have an armor value to the right of the card
                title.  Armor prevents an amount of damage equal to the armor
                value that the creature would take each turn.

                * If a creature gains armor, the gains are additive and
                  accumulate on top fo the creature's printed armor value.
                * If a creature gains armor during a turn, the gained armor
                  does not absorb damage already dealt that turn.  If a
                  creature loses armor during a turn, it is not retroactively
                  dealt damage that was already absorbed.
                * If a creature has "~" symbol in its armor field, the creature
                  has no armor.  These creatures may gain armor through card
                  effects.
          - name: Assault (X)
            id: assault
            text: |
                When a creature with the assault (X) keyword attacks, it deals
                damage equal to its assault value (i.e. "X") to the creature
                it is fighting **before** the fight resolves.  The active
                player chooses whether this occurs before or after other
                "Before Fight" effects and keywords.  If this destroys the
                other creature, the rest of the fight does not occur.

                * If a creature with the assault (X) keyword gains another
                  instance of the assault (X) keyword, the 2 "X" values are
                  added together.

                If the word "before" is used in an ability (Ex:
                "**Before Reap:**"), that ability resolves before resolving
                the game effect of the reap/fight/etc., but after the card
                exhausts if exhausting is required to use the card.

            text: |
                Captured Æmber is taken from an opponent's poll and placed
                on a creature controlled by the capturing player. **Players
                may not spend captured Æmber**.

                When a creature with Æmber on it leaves play, the Æmber is
                placed in the opponent's pool.

            text: |
                If a player gains chains, the player increases their chain
                tracker by the number of chains gained.

                If a player has any chains when refilling their hand, they
                draw fewer cards.

                | Chains | Draw Reduction |
                | ------ | -------------- |
                | 1 - 6 | 1 fewer card |
                | 7 - 12 | 2 fewer cards |

          - name: Control
            id: control
            text: |
                A player owns the cards that begin the game in their deck.
                When a card enters play, it is under its owner's control.

                * A player can take control of an opponent's card.  When this
                  happens, that card is placed in the new controller's play
                  area.  If it is a creature, it is placed on a flank of the
                  new controller's battleline.
                * If a player takes control of a card that belongs to a house
                  not in the new controller's deck, they can make that house
                  the active house during step 2 of their turn.
                * If a card that has changed control leaves play for any
                  reason, it moves to its owner's appropriate out-of-play
                  area.

                Damage a creature has taken is tracked by placing damage
                tokens on the creature.  If a creature has an amount of damage
                on >= to its power, the creature is destroyed.

                * **Damage on a creature does not reduce its power**.
