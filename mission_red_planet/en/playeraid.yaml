          <p>Assemble the 4 <b>Mars board</b> pieces in the center of the play
          area. Place <b>Phobos</b> and the <b>Lost in Space Memorial</b> 
          nearby.</p>
          <p>Assemble the <b>launchpad</b> out of a number of dock pieces
          equal to the number of players. Attach the end cap docks
          to the ends.</p>
          <p>Place the <b>destination tokens</b> within reach of all players,
          and sort the point tokens into piles by type. Place the Ice
          Monopoly <b>global mission card</b> faceup near the tokens.</p>
          <p>Shuffle the <b>ship cards</b> and place the deck near the 
          launchpad.
          Draw a number of cards equal to the number of players and
          place one ship, faceup, at each dock of the launchpad.</p>
          <p>If a drawn ship has an unknown destination, replace it
          with a new card and shuffle the unknown destination ship
          back into the ship deck. If a Phobos-bound ship is not
          drawn, place a <b>Phobos destination token</b> on the ship at the
          rightmost dock.</p>
          <p>Each player chooses a color and takes the 9 <b>character
          cards</b> of that color as his starting hand of cards, and all the
          plastic <b>astronauts</b> of that color.</p>
          <p>Take 1 astronaut from each player and randomly place one
          on each ship at the launchpad. The player whose astronaut
          is on the left-most dock is the <b>first player</b> and takes the
          <b>round tracker</b>, setting it to 1.</p>
          <p>Randomly place 1 <b>resource token</b> facedown in each zone of
          Mars, and on Phobos. Place the remaining resource token
          facedown near the token supply.</p>
          <p>Shuffle the <b>mission cards</b> and deal 2 to each player. Each
          player chooses 1 card to keep facedown in his play area,
          and places the unchosen card facedown on top of the
          undealt mission cards. Chosen mission cards remain hidden
          from other players until the end of the game.</p>
          <p>Shuffle the <b>discovery cards</b>, the <b>action cards</b>, and 
          all remaining <b>mission cards</b> together to create the 
          <b>event deck</b> and place it facedown near the token supply.</p>

                <b>Each player simultaneously chooses 1 character card from

                <p><b>Players reveal and resolve their characters’ effects, and
                docked ships can become full and launch.</b></p>
                <p>Each character card has a number which determines when
                the card is revealed. The first player begins reciting the
                <b>countdown to blastoff</b>, announcing each character number
                starting with the number 9.</p>
                <p>Each player whose facedown card matches the announced
                character number flips it faceup and resolves its effect.
                If 2 or more players reveal the same character, they resolve
                their effects in clockwise order, starting with the first 
                player.</p>
                <p>After all players who revealed the announced character have
                resolved its effect, or if no player chose the announced
                character, the first player continues the countdown by
                announcing the next character in descending order, and so on
                until all players have revealed their chosen character 
                cards.</p>
                <p><b>Character effects must be resolved from top to 
                bottom</b> in
                the order written on the card. Played character cards remain
                faceup in front of the owner and visible for all to see.</p>
                <p>Once a character is used, it cannot be used again until the
                player plays the <i>Recruiter</i> card to return all of his
                played cards to his hand.</p>
                <p><b>A docked ship is full when the number of astronauts on
                it is equal to its capacity number</b>. When ship is full, it
                launches. The first player slides the ship card away from
                the launchpad to indicate that the ship has launched.</p>
                <p>Ships launch only if they become full or due to a game
                effect such as the <i>Secret Agent</i>. Ships that are not
                full stay docked at the launchpad.</p>

                destination token covering the destination printed on the
                ship card, the ship instead lands in the zone indicated on
                the token.</p>
                <p>When an astronaut is placed in a zone with a facedown
                resource token, the resource token is flipped faceup,
                revealing which resource is present in that zone.</p>
                <p>After landing a ship, place it faceup next to the ship deck
                in the ship discard pile. If it had a destination token, return
                the token to the supply.</p>

            text: >
                <b>New ships are docked at the launchpad</b>. For each open
                dock at the launchpad, the first player draws 1 ship card
                and places it faceup at an open dock. If the ship deck is
                depleted, shuffle its discard pile and place it facedown to
                create a new deck.

    - name: Production Phase
      text: >
          <p>There are 3 production phases shown on the round tracker.
          During a production phase, <b>each zone with a faceup resource
          token produces point tokens of its resource type</b> equal to the
          number of dots shown in the production phase icon.</p>
          <p>Then, players receive point tokens based on majority in
          each zone. If only one player has the most astronauts in
          a zone, he receives all the point tokens from that zone. If
          two or more players tie for the most astronauts in a zone,
          the tied players evenly distribute the point tokens from
          that zone.</p>
          <p>Any remaining point tokens stay in the zone and can
          possibly be won at a later time. If there are no astronauts in
          a zone, the point tokens stay in that zone.</p>
          <p>At the end of each production phase, the first player
          advances the round tracker to the next notch.</p>
    - name: Reveal Discovery Phase
      text: >
          <p>The first player flips all discovery cards in play faceup. Each
          discovery card effect resolves during the phase indicated by
          the icon in the lower-right corner of the card:</p>
          Reveal Discovery Phase: <img src="/static/img/mission_red_planet/reveal_discovery_phase.png" width="30" height="30" /><br/>

          <p>At the end of the Reveal Discovery phase, the
          first player advances the round tracker.</p>
    - name: Final Scoring Phase
      text: >
          <p>Players reveal their mission cards and determine if they
          were completed. The player(s) with the most ice point
          tokens gain points for completing the Ice Monopoly global
          mission. Then each player calculates his final score:</p>
          <ol><li>Add points from your completed missions.</li>
          <li>Add the total value of all your collected point tokens.</li>
          <li>Adds or subtract points from discoveries that affect you</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Players compare final scores, and <b>the player with the
          highest score wins the game</b>. On a tie, the tied player who
          has the largest quantity of point tokens (regardless of value)
          wins. On a further tie, the tied players share the victory.</p>
    - name: Event Cards
      text: >
          <p>There are 3 types of event cards: <b>discoveries, missions,</b>
          and <b>actions</b>. Event cards are drawn when dealing starting
          missions during setup and by the <i>Scientist’s</i> effect.</p>
          <p><b>Discoveries</b> are scientific phenomenons or geographical
          features that can be found on Mars. When you draw a
          discovery card, assign it facedown to any outer zone of Mars
          by physically sliding a portion of the card under the board.
          At the end of the game, discovery cards provide either a
          positive or negative effect (eg, that zone produces more
          point tokens).</p>
          <p><b>Missions</b> are secret objectives that award points to the
          owner if he completes them. When you draw a mission card,
          look at it and keep it facedown in your play area. It remains
          hidden until the final scoring phase.</p>
          <p><b>Actions</b> are special effects that can occur at different 
          times in the game. When you draw an action card, look at it and
          keep it facedown in your play area. Keep it hidden until the
          text specifies when to play it.</p>
    - name: Destination Tokens
      text: >
          <p><b>Destination tokens</b> are used by the Pilot’s effect and by
          the player who places the first astronaut in a ship with an
          <b>unknown (?)</b> destination. When either of these situations
          occur, the active player takes any destination token from the
          supply and places it on top of the ship’s printed destination.
          This ship is now bound for the token’s destination.</p>
          <p>The destination token supply is limited to 2 tokens per
          zone. When a ship with a destination token lands, return the
          token to the supply.</p>
    - name: Lost in Space Memorial
      text: >
          <p>The <i>Femme Fatale</i> and <i>Soldier</i> effects kill 
          astronauts, who are then sent to the <b>Lost in Space Memorial</b>.
          Also, any astronauts aboard a docked ship that is destroyed by a
          <i>Saboteur</i> are killed and sent to the Lost in Space Memorial.
          The Lost in Space Memorial is not a zone.</p>
    - name: Phobos
      text: >
          <b>Phobos</b> behaves like the other Mars zones except it is not
          adjacent to any other zone and discovery cards cannot be
          assigned to it.
    - name: Ice Monopoly Mission
      text: >
          The <i>Ice Monopoly</i> mission is a global mission and can
          therefore be completed by any player. During final scoring,
          the player with the most ice point tokens has completed the
          mission and gains 9 points. On a tie for the most ice tokens,
          the tied players divide up the 9 points (rounded down).
    - name: Character Cards

          <p>All character effects are mandatory and must be fully
          resolved; if this is not possible, resolve as fully as possible.
          The <i>Travel Agent’s</i> effect, which must be fully resolved or
          not at all, is the exception. A player must fully resolve his
          character’s effect before any full ships can launch.</p>
          <p><b>9 Recruiter</b> Take all of your played
          character cards back into your hand,
          including the <i>Recruiter</i> card.</p>
          <p><b>8 Explorer</b> To make a move, moves one
          of your astronauts from its current zone to
          an adjacent zone. The same astronaut can
          be moved multiple times. When you move an
          astronaut to a zone with a facedown resource
          token, flip that token faceup.</p>
          <p><b>7 Scientist</b> After looking at a facedown
          discovery card, return it facedown to its
          assigned zone. If all outer zones already have
          a discovery card assigned to them and you
          draw a discovery card, discard it faceup next
          to the event deck and look at a facedown
          discovery card in play.</p>
          <p><b>6 Secret Agent</b> You can force a ship that
          has 0 astronauts on board to launch.</p>
          <p><b>5 Saboteur</b> All astronauts on a destroyed
          ship are killed and placed on the Lost in
          Space Memorial, and then the destroyed ship
          is discarded.</p>
          <p><b>4 Femme Fatale</b> The replace effect
          can target astronauts in a docked ship, a
          launched ship, or any zone of Mars (including
          Phobos) in which at least one of your own
          astronauts is already present. The replaced
          astronaut is killed and placed on the Lost in
          Space Memorial.</p>
          <p><b>3 Travel Agent</b> If there is not a docked
          ship with room for at least 3 more astronauts,
          ignore this effect and skip your turn.</p>
          <p><b>2 Soldier</b> The <i>kill</i> effect can target
          astronauts in any zone except <i>Syrtis Major</i>
          and <i>Valles Marineris</i>. You can kill your own
          astronauts. Astronauts that are moved at the
          same time are not required to go to the same
          zone. You must move at least 1 astronaut.</p>
          <p><b>1 Pilot</b> The <i>place a destination token</i> effect
          can target either a docked ship or a launched
          ship. Destination tokens can be placed
          on top of other destination tokens, thus
          changing that ship’s destination again.</p>

                assigned cards cannot be removed, overridden, or replaced.</p>
                <p>Discovery cards have effects that can resolve when revealed
                (during the reveal discovery phase), during the third

                takes precedence; no point tokens are placed in that zone.</p>
                <p><b>Subterfuge:</b> On a tie for second-most astronauts,
                those tied players evenly distribute the point tokens. On a

                showing it to your opponent.</p>
                <p>When resolving a neutral <i>Recruiter</i>, the controlling
                player first returns that <i>Recruiter</i> card to the game
                box. Then, you shuffle the other 8 neutral character cards 
                and place them facedown to create a new character deck for 
                that neutral color.</p>
                <p>Because character effects are mandatory, there may arise
                situations when a neutral character effect does not help (or
                even harms) its controlling player.</p>
          - name: Points for Neutral Colors
            text: >
                <p>When resolving event cards, treat the neutral colors as
                separate players for the purposes of counting resources
                and scoring points. Neutral colors can complete the <i>Ice
                Monopoly</i> global mission.</p>
                <p>When a color receives point tokens, they are placed in
                that color’s play area. Neutral colors receive point tokens
                for themselves, so they are not shared with the controlling
                player’s main color.</p>

                <p>When players compare final scores, they do so for each
                color. The color with the highest score wins. If either neutral
                color has the highest score, then players lose. Otherwise,
                the player whose main color has the highest score wins.</p>
                <p>On a tie between a main color and a neutral color, the main
                color wins. On a tie between both main colors, the color
                who has the largest quantity of point tokens (regardless of
                value) wins the game. If there is still a tie, the tied players
                share the victory.</p>
