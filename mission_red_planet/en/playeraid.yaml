        - name: 1. Choose Character
          text: >
              <b>Each player simultaneously chooses 1 character card from
              his hand</b> and places it facedown in front of him.
        - name: 2. Resolve Effects
          text: >
              <p>The first player begins reciting the <b>countdown to 
              blastoff</b>, announcing each character number starting with 
              the number 9.</p>
              <p>Each player whose facedown card matches the announced 
              character number flips it faceup and resolves its effect.</p>
              <p>After all players who revealed the announced
              character have resolved its effect, or if no
              player chose the announced character, the
              first player continues the countdown by
              announcing the next character in descending
              order, and so on until all players have
              revealed their chosen character cards.</p>
              <p><b>Character effects must be resolved from top
              to bottom</b> in the order written on the card.
              Played character cards remain faceup in front
              of the owner and visible for all to see.</p>
              <p>A used character cannot be used again until
              the player plays the Recruiter card to return
              all of his played cards to his hand.</p>
              <p><b>A docked ship is full when the number of
              astronauts on it is equal to its capacity
              number.</b> A full ship launches (slide the ship
              card away from the launchpad).</p>
              <p>Ships launch only if they become full or due
              to an effect such as the Secret Agent. Ships
              that are not full stay docked.</p>
        - name: 3. Land Launched Ships
          text: >
              <p><b>Each launched ship lands on Mars, unloading all astronauts 
              aboard that ship in the indicated zone.</b> When an astronaut is 
              placed in a zone with a facedown resource token, the resource 
              token is flipped faceup.</p><p>After landing a ship, place it 
              faceup next to the ship deck in the ship discard pile and 
              return any destination token to the supply.</p>
        - name: 4. Draw New Ships
          text: >
              For each open dock at the launchpad, the first player draws 1 
              ship card and places it faceup at an open dock.
        - name: 5. Assign First Player
          text: >
              <b>The player who resolved his character effect last takes the 
              round tracker</b> and is the new first player.
        - name: 6. Advance Tracker
          text: >
              <b>The first player slides the gauge clockwise until the 
              pointer lines up with the next notch.</b>
    - name: Production Phase
      text: >
          <p>During a production phase, each zone with a faceup resource 
          token produces point tokens of its resource type equal to the 
          number of dots shown in the production phase icon.</p><p>Then, 
          players receive point tokens based on majority in each zone. If 
          only one player has the most astronauts in a zone, he receives 
          all the point tokens from that zone. If two or more players tie 
          for the most astronauts in a zone, the tied players evenly 
          distribute the point tokens from that zone</p><p>Any remaining 
          point tokens stay in the zone.  If there are no astronauts in a 
          zone, the point tokens stay in that zone.</p><p>At the end of 
          each production phase, the first player advances the round 
          tracker to the next notch.</p>
    - name: Reveal Discovery
      text: >
          <p>The first player flips all discovery cards in play faceup. 
          Each discovery card effect resolves during the phase 
          indicated:</p>

          <img src="/static/img/final_scoring_phase.png" width="30" height="30" />
          <p>At the end of the Reveal Discovery phase, the 
          first player advances the round tracker.</p>
    - name: Final Scoring
      text: >
          <p>Players reveal their mission cards and
          determine if they were completed. Player(s)
          with the most ice point tokens gain points for
          completing the Ice Monopoly mission.</p>
          <p>Each player then calculates his final score:
          add points from your completed missions;
          the total value of all your collected point
          tokens; and add or subtract points from
          discoveries that affect you.</p>
          <p><b>The player with the highest score wins.</b></p>
    - name: Event Cards
      text: >
          <p><b>Discoveries</b> are assigned facedown to any
          outer zone of Mars. At the end of the game,
          discovery cards provide either a positive or
          negative effect.</p>
          <p><b>Missions</b> are kept facedown in your play area,
          hidden until the final scoring phase.</p>
          <p><b>Actions</b> are kept facedown in your play area,
          hidden until the specified time to play them.</p>
    - name: Character Cards
      text: >
          <p><b>9 Recruiter</b> Take all of your played
          character cards back into your hand,
          including the <i>Recruiter</i> card.</p>
          <p><b>8 Explorer</b> To make a move, moves one
          of your astronauts from its current zone to
          an adjacent zone. The same astronaut can
          be moved multiple times. When you move an
          astronaut to a zone with a facedown resource
          token, flip that token faceup.</p>
          <p><b>7 Scientist</b> After looking at a facedown
          discovery card, return it facedown to its
          assigned zone. If all outer zones already have
          a discovery card assigned to them and you
          draw a discovery card, discard it faceup next
          to the event deck and look at a facedown
          discovery card in play.</p>
          <p><b>6 Secret Agent</b> You can force a ship that
          has 0 astronauts on board to launch.</p>
          <p><b>5 Saboteur</b> All astronauts on a destroyed
          ship are killed and placed on the Lost in
          Space Memorial, and then the destroyed ship
          is discarded.</p>
          <p><b>4 Femme Fatale</b> The replace effect
          can target astronauts in a docked ship, a
          launched ship, or any zone of Mars (including
          Phobos) in which at least one of your own
          astronauts is already present. The replaced
          astronaut is killed and placed on the Lost in
          Space Memorial.</p>
          <p><b>3 Travel Agent</b> If there is not a docked
          ship with room for at least 3 more astronauts,
          ignore this effect and skip your turn.</p>
          <p><b>2 Soldier</b> The <i>kill</i> effect can target
          astronauts in any zone except <i>Syrtis Major</i>
          and <i>Valles Marineris</i>. You can kill your own
          astronauts. Astronauts that are moved at the
          same time are not required to go to the same
          zone. You must move at least 1 astronaut.</p>
          <p><b>1 Pilot</b> The <i>place a destination token</i> effect
          can target either a docked ship or a launched
          ship. Destination tokens can be placed
          on top of other destination tokens, thus
          changing that shipâ€™s destination again.</p>
