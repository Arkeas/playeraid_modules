        - name: 1. Choose Character
          text: >
              <b>Each player simultaneously chooses 1 character card from
              his hand</b> and places it facedown in front of him.
        - name: 2. Resolve Effects
          text: >
              <p>The first player begins reciting the <b>countdown to 
              blastoff</b>, announcing each character number starting with 
              the number 9.</p>
              <p>Each player whose facedown card matches the announced 
              character number flips it faceup and resolves its effect.</p>
              <p>After all players who revealed the announced
              character have resolved its effect, or if no
              player chose the announced character, the
              first player continues the countdown by
              announcing the next character in descending
              order, and so on until all players have
              revealed their chosen character cards.</p>
              <p><b>Character effects must be resolved from top
              to bottom</b> in the order written on the card.
              Played character cards remain faceup in front
              of the owner and visible for all to see.</p>
              <p>A used character cannot be used again until
              the player plays the Recruiter card to return
              all of his played cards to his hand.</p>
              <p><b>A docked ship is full when the number of
              astronauts on it is equal to its capacity
              number.</b> A full ship launches (slide the ship
              card away from the launchpad).</p>
              <p>Ships launch only if they become full or due
              to an effect such as the Secret Agent. Ships
              that are not full stay docked.</p>
        - name: 3. Land Launched Ships
          text: >
              <p><b>Each launched ship lands on Mars, unloading all astronauts 
              aboard that ship in the indicated zone.</b> When an astronaut is 
              placed in a zone with a facedown resource token, the resource 
              token is flipped faceup.</p><p>After landing a ship, place it 
              faceup next to the ship deck in the ship discard pile and 
              return any destination token to the supply.</p>

              pointer lines up with the next notch.</b>
    - name: Production Phase
      text: >
          <p>During a production phase, each zone with a faceup resource 
          token produces point tokens of its resource type equal to the 
          number of dots shown in the production phase icon.</p><p>Then, 
          players receive point tokens based on majority in each zone. If 
          only one player has the most astronauts in a zone, he receives 
          all the point tokens from that zone. If two or more players tie 
          for the most astronauts in a zone, the tied players evenly 
          distribute the point tokens from that zone</p><p>Any remaining 
          point tokens stay in the zone.  If there are no astronauts in a 
          zone, the point tokens stay in that zone.</p><p>At the end of 
          each production phase, the first player advances the round 
          tracker to the next notch.</p>
    - name: Reveal Discovery
      text: >
          <p>The first player flips all discovery cards in play faceup. 
          Each discovery card effect resolves during the phase 
          indicated:</p><p>At the end of the Reveal Discovery phase, the 
          first player advances the round tracker.</p>
