                <b>The Goblin Sneak:</b> When the Goblin Sneak visits the same
                location as one or more opponents, <b>prior to activating
                any effects</b>, you may attempt to pickpocket. Choose an
                opponent present at the location and name a category.
                That opponent must give you a card containing a book
                of that category, if able, or show you a hand containing
                none. Repeat this process for each opponent present at
                that location. Any cards acquired this way may be shelved.

                <p><b>The Mummy:</b>When the Mummy shelves a card, you may
                entomb the card by placing it either directly on top of,
                or directly underneath, a previously shelved card in your
                bookshelf. The bottom card of the stack is flipped face
                down and its icons no longer count during scoring. You
                may never have more than one card under each card in
                your bookshelf. At the end of the game, entombed cards
                in your bookshelf are worth <b>2 points</b> each. Add the total
                to your shelf stability bonus.</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b>If the top card of an entombed stack is discarded for
                any reason, the card remaining underneath is no longer
                considered entombed, but stays flipped face down.</p>

                <b>The Automaton:</b> When the Automaton visits a location
                or your library, <b>prior to activating any effects</b>, you may
                perform one home action for each of your other assistants
                already present at the location.

                <b>The Gelatinous Cube:</b> If an opposing assitant visits the
                same location as the Gelatinous Cube, <b>prior to activating
                any effects or abilities</b>, they must either:
                <ol><li>Give you a random card from their hand <b>-OR-</b></li>
                <li>Allow you to perform <b>both</b> home actions</li></ol>

                <b>The Sasquatch:</b> The Sasquatch may only visit locations
                where opposing assistants are not present. If an opposing
                assistant visits the same location as the Sasquatch, <b>before
                they activate any effects or abilities</b>, you may choose
                to retrieve the Sasquatch — it may be placed again on a
                subsequent turn this round.

            text: >
                <p><b>The Ghost:</b> The Ghost may not visit the <b>Diviner's
                Hut</b>. (The Diviner has warded her hut from uninvited
                spirits.)</p>
                <p>You may place the Ghost on assistant spaces that are
                occupied by opposing assistants at locations with instant
                effects; the two assistants share the space. When you do
                so, <b>prior to activating any effects or abilities</b>, draw
                one card from the deck. Afterward, activate the location’s
                effect. You may not use this ability on locations with
                delayed effects.</p>

            text: >
                <b>The Bookworm:</b> When the Bookworm visits a home action
                space, you may perform <b>both</b> home actions. Afterward,
                you may discard a card from your hand or bookshelf to
                repeat the process once.

                assistant space at a location with an instant effect, no
                more assistants may visit the location.

                <b>The Trash Golem:</b> If the Trash Golem is present at a
                location during step <b>2</b> of the Resolution Phase, you may
                choose one card that would be discarded from each
                location as it resolves and either take it or shelve it.
                Continue this process until the Trash Golem’s location
                itself is resolved and its token returns to you.

                <b>The Witch:</b> Any time the Witch acquires a card containing
                at least one Banned Book, reveal the top card of the deck.
                You may take either the original card or the revealed card,
                then discard whichever card you did not take.

            text: >
                <b>The Wizard:</b> When the Wizard shelves a card, you may
                shift a group of any number of adjacent cards in your
                bookshelf one space in any direction to create one or more
                empty spaces, then shelve the new card in a newly created
                empty space. Your bookshelf may disconnect temporarily,
                so long as it follows all shelving rules after the new card
                is added.

                <p><b>The Fire Imp:</b> When the Fire Imp visits a location with
                one or more cards in its card area, <b>prior to activating any
                effects</b>, you may either:
                <ol><li>Discard one card from the location's card area to
                perform one home action <b>-OR-</b></li>
                <li>Discard ALL cards from the location's card area to
                perform two home actions</li></ol></p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> If a location tile has only one card in its card
                area, you may only choose option <b>A</b> above.</p>

                assistant you have placed this round, including this one.
                Next, take the first player token from the player who
                currently has it.  If you already have the first player token,
                keep it.</p>

                effect if you have no cards in your hand, or if there are no
                cards in <b>Ye Olde Book Swap's</b> card area.</p>
