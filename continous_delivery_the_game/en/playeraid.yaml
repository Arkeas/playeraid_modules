name: Continuous Delivery - The Game
description: The Game is a cooperative
             game for 3-5 players who together
             will try to transform a software development
             waterfall way of working into a Continuous
             Delivery pipeline.
             Each player represents a department, for
             instance Development, Test or Operations.
             Together they can discuss and plan how to
             improve the software development process.

      - name: Select one Role card
        text: Each player selects one Role card. This can
              be done randomly or by selecting what you
              want to play. The roles Development, Test
              and Operations need always be part of the
              game, otherwise Improvements cannot be
              invested in. If playing with four (4) players
              add either Extra Resource or Continuous
              Delivery Expert to the game. If playing with
              five (5) players, add both. It is possible to play
              with less than three players, in that case give
              more than one Role card to each player.

        text: You can finally get those
              Improvements in place
              If an Improvement has been fully invested
              in (compare the amount and
              colors of the Time Tokens placed on
              the card to those printed on the card),
              play it and draw another from the pile
              to replace the used one. All spent
              Time Tokens on that Improvement
              (red, yellow and green) are given back to the
              players.
              <li>If playing with more than three roles,
              you may also have blue Time Tokens in play.
              Remember that these are not given back to
              the players in this way.</li>
              <li>If an Improvement card states that a square
              should be replaced, put the Improvement on
              that square and the square is not in use any
              more. All Work Items that are moving to this
              square should just ignore it and go to the
              next, non-replaced, square. If you replace a
              square that has Work Items on it, move all
              Work Items to the next square (toward IN
              PRODUCTION) before putting the Improvement
              card on the square.</li>
              <li>The different players get tokens back,
