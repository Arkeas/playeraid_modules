name: Continuous Delivery - The Game
description: The Game is a cooperative
             game for 3-5 players who together
             will try to transform a software development
             waterfall way of working into a Continuous
             Delivery pipeline.
             Each player represents a department, for
             instance Development, Test or Operations.
             Together they can discuss and plan how to
             improve the software development process.
