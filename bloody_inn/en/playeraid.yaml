          *  Give each player 2 Peasant cards and a player aid.  Place your
             player aid on the table as it also serves as a barn.
          *  Build the Traveler deck based on the player count and game length:

          | Players | Short Game | Long Game |
          | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
          | 2 players | remove 35 cards | remove 25 cards |
          | 3 players | remove 28 cards | remove 16 cards |
          | 4 players | remove 22 cards | remove 6 cards |

          *  Shuffle the remaining cards and place the cards at the left of
             the board with the living side face-up.
          *  Each player receives 8 key/room service tokens and disc in their
             player color.  Place the disc on the 5F space of the wealth track.
          *  Each player takes 1 10F check.
          *  Determine which rooms are open:
              *  Each player places a key token of their color on an unclaimed
                 room of their choice.
              *  In a 2 or 3 player game, place a key tokon of the neutral
                 color on each of 3 doors of the inn.  In a 4 player game,
                 place 1 on each of the 4.
          * The greediest player takes the first player card.

          The game is divided into 2 seasons.  A season is traversal through
          the deck.  When the Entrance stack becomes empty for the 1st time,
          shuffle the Exit stack to form a new Entrance stack. After the 2nd
          time through the deck, do a normal final round, even if the inn is
          not full. **Don't play the final round if there are fewer travelers
          in the inn than the number of players**.

          Each round is divided into 3 phases.

          - name: "Phase 1: Welcome Travelers (Evening)"
            text: |
                The 1st player performs the following steps:

                *  Draw the top card of the Entrance stack
                *  Place the traveler in an open (has a key token), unoccupied
                   (has no traveler) room of their choice
                *  Reiterate this process until there is a traveler in each
                   open room
          - name: "Phase 2: Player Actions (Night)"
            text: |
                Starting with the 1st player, in clockwise order each player
                performs an action.  Then go around once more so each player
                can perform a 2nd action.

                There are 5 different actions you may take on your turn:

                1. Bribe a Guest
                2. Build an Annex
                3. Kill a Guest
                4. Bury a Corpse
                5. Pass (and Launder Money)

                Actions 1-4 operate on the same principle:
                
                *  You choose a Guest card in play (in your hand or in the inn,
                   as appropriate)
                *  You must play a number of cards defined by the rank of the
                   chosen card
                *  Reclaim any cards you played that have an aptitude for the
                   chosen action.  The other cards are lost.
                *  Perform the action
            sections:
                - name: 1. Bribe a Guest
                  text: |
                      This allows you to take a Guest card from the inn into
                      your hand.

                      *  Select the traveler you want to bribe from among those
                         renting rooms at the inn (the room owner does not
                         matter).
                      *  Play as many Guest cards from your hand as the rank
                         of the traveler you chose.
                      *  From the cards just played, return any cards with the
                         ![money](/static/img/bloody_inn/money.png) icon to
                         your hand .  Put the other cards in the exit stack,
                         **except Peasants, which go in the bistro instead**.
                      *  Add the bribed guest to your hand

                      It is also possible to **bribe the peasants** in the
                      bistro.  If you bribe the peasants, take 1 or 2 and them
                      to your hand.
                - name: 2. Build an Annex
                  text: |
                      This allows you to place one of your Guest cards in
                      your hand in front of you to use its power.  Annexes
                      are also needed to bury corpses.

                      *  Choose a traveler **from your hand** that depicts an
                         annex.
                      *  Play as many Guest cards from your hand as the rank
                         of the traveler you chose.
                      *  From the cards just played, return cards with the
                         ![trowel](/static/img/bloody_inn/trowel.png)
                         icon to your hand. Put the other cards in the exit
                         stack, **except Peasants, which go in the bistro
                         instead**.
                      *  Place the traveler card in front of you, Living side
                         face-up.  This is now an annex.  There is no limit
                         to the number of annexes you can have.  You can also
                         have more than 1 copy of the same annex.
                      
                      **Note**: Police and Peasant cards **cannot** become
                      annexes.
                - name: 3. Kill a Guest
                  text: |
                      When you kill a guest, you put them in front of you
                      Dead-side-up.

                      *  Select the traveler you want to kill **from the inn**.
                         It's also possible to kill Peasants.
                      *  Play as many Guest cards from your hand as the rank
                         of the traveler you chose.
                      *  From the cards played, return cards with the
                         ![gun](/static/img/bloody_inn/gun.png) icon to your
                         hand .  Put the other cards in the exit stack,
                         **except Peasants, which go in the bistro instead**.
                      *  Place the Guest card in front of you with the Dead
                         side face up (this is now a **corpse**).  There is no
                         limit to the number of corpses you can have in
                         front of you.
                - name: 4. Bury a Corpse
                  text: |
                      You may bury the **corpse** of a guest you **killed in
                      a previous action**.

                      *  Select the corpse you want to bury from those in
                         front of you.
                      *  Play as many Guest cards from your hand as the rank
                         of the traveler you chose.
                      *  From the cards played, return cards with the
                         ![casket](/static/img/bloody_inn/gun.png) icon to
                         your hand .  Put the other cards in the exit stack,
                         **except Peasants, which go in the bistro instead**.
                      *  Place the corpse card under an annex of your choice,
                         **regardless of who owns it**, leaving the bottom
                         of the card (with the money amount) showing.  The
                         number of bodies you can bury under an annex is
                         equal to the rank of the annex.  **You and the
                         owner of the annex** split the money (you get all
                         of it if buried under your own annex).  Note that
                         you **can bury a corpse under the "barn"**.
                      
                      **Important**: It is **impossible** to have more than
                      40 francs on the wealth track.  If you would exceed
                      40, the excess is lost.
                - name: 5. Pass (and Launder Money)
                  text: |
                      You can choose not to do any of the previous actions and
                      pass instead.  If you do, you *may* "Launder Money".
                      You can either:
                      
                      *  Exchange a portion of your cash for 10F checks.
                      *  Cash checks in order to increase your cash on the
                         wealth track.
