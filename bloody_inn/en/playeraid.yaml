          *  Give each player 2 Peasant cards and a player aid.  Place your
             player aid on the table as it also serves as a barn.
          *  Build the Traveler deck based on the player count and game length:
          | Players | Short Game | Long Game |
          | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
          | 2 players | remove 35 cards | remove 25 cards |
          | 3 players | remove 28 cards | remove 16 cards |
          | 4 players | remove 22 cards | remove 6 cards |
          *  Shuffle the remaining cards and place the cards at the left of
             the board with the living side face-up.
          *  Each player receives 8 key/room service tokens and disc in their
             player color.  Place the disc on the 5F space of the wealth track.
          *  Each player takes 1 10F check.
          *  Determine which rooms are open:
              *  Each player places a key token of their color on an unclaimed
                 room of their choice.
              *  In a 2 or 3 player game, place a key tokon of the neutral
                 color on each of 3 doors of the inn.  In a 4 player game,
                 place 1 on each of the 4.
          * The greediest player takes the first player card.
