                Players collect income and produce goods from their units
                deployed on the map.  The amount of money and goods is
                indicated by the empty slots on the player board where units
                have been removed which show a "plus" icon.
                
                *  Each deployed worker earns money (each worker below the 1st

                scoring marker (top half), players earn the glory bonus
                indicated on the bottom half of the marker. Glory is tracked
                on the export board with players' glory markers.

    - name: Final Scoring
      text: |
          Final scoring happens after 5 rounds.  Final scoring is the sum of
          the following:

          *  **Glory**: 1 VP for each step on the glory track.
          *  **Basic Goods**: 1 VP for each basic good in your stock.
          *  **Processed Goods**: 2 VP for each processed good in your stock.
          *  **Money**: 1 VP for every £10.  **Leftover money breaks ties in
             the final score**.
          *  **Hops**: 1 VP for each Hop imported, as listed on your fulfilled
             export contracts.
          *  **Cotton, Tobacco, and Sugar Cane**: 3, 4, 5 each according to
             their rarity.  The rarest imported good is the most valuable.
              *  The import token that was moved the furthest on the track is
                 the most common imported good and worth 3 points.  The next
                 most imported is worth 4 points, and the least imported is
                 worth 5 points.
              *  **If there is a tie for imported goods**, cotton is the rarest
                 followed by tobacco, then sugar cane.
          *  **Export Scoring**: Each player counts the number of fulfilled
             export contracts and scores as follows:
              *  **3/4 players**: 12 VP for the player with the most fulfilled
                 contracts, 6 VP for the 2nd most.
              *  **2 players**: 8 VP for the player with the most fulfilled
                 contracts.
              *  In case of a tie, evenly divide the VP of the tiers, rounded
                 down.
          *  **Settlement Scoring**: Each player counts the **number of their
             settlements within shipping reach of each other**.
              *  A settlement is a cluster of neighboring units of 1 color
                 (adjacent and **no river in between**).
              *  Single units are also considered settlements.
              *  If not all your settlements are within shipping reach of each
                 other, the **biggest** group of settlements counts in this
                 scoring.
              *  **3/4 players**: The player with the most **settlements**
                  gets 18 VP, 2nd most gets 12 VP, 3rd most gets 6 VP.
              *  **2 players**: The player with the most **settlements** gets
                  12 VP.
              *  In case of a tie, evenly divide the VP of the tiers, rounded
                 down.

          The shaded spaces at the edge, also marked by mist, are not part of
          the active map and so players cannot expand into them. This is

                The following are good for a 1st game.

                ## Static Import Goods
                No matter how much cotton, tobacco, or sugar cane was imported,
                each is worth 4 VP at the end of the game. If you use this,
                you do not need to track these on the export board.

                ## Without Scoring and/or Port Tiles
                Players can ignore the scoring tiles and/or the port tiles
                during setup and play.

                Use the backsides of 4 spare port tiles to cover any 4 land
                spaces of the **active** map during the setup in a 2/3 player
                game, preferably 1 tile per map module.  These spaces cannot
                be expanded into.

                For more symmetric play, ignore the clans during setup and
                play. **In addition to the goods and money on the starting
                tile**, players also receive:

                *  2nd player: £2
                *  3rd player: £4
                *  4th player: £6

            text: |
                Apply the following auction mechanism to auction clans.

                1.  Randomly draw as many clan tiles as the number of players
                    and allocate a random starting tile to each clan.
                2.  Randomly determine a player who bids any number of VP (can
                    be 0) to be able to choose a clan 1st.
                3.  The player to their left can bid any higher amount of VP
                4.  Continue until everyone passes after a bid.  30 VP is the
                    highest possible bid
                5.  The player winning the bid writes down their bid as
                    negative VP on the score sheet and places their token
                    on the first space of the turn order track and takes
                    their choice of clan/starting tiles.
                6.  The player to their left bids for 1 of the remaining clans.
                7.  Continue until the last player is given the remaining
                    clan/starting tiles at no cost.
