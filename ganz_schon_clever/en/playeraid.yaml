          * Each player takes a pen and score sheet
          * Randomly choose a start player, who gets the 6 dice

          The game is played over 4 (4 players), 5 (3 players), or 6
          (1 and 2 player) rounds.  At the start of the first 4 rounds,
          each player gets 1 bonus, as shown on the round tracker on the
          score sheet (players choose 1 of the 2 options in round 4).
      sections:
          - name: Active Player

                1. The active player rolls all 6 dice at once, then chooses 1,
                   placing it on of their 3 dice fields (top left of score
                   sheet), without changing the number of the die.
                2. Using the chosen die, the player must now use the value and
                   the color to mark on his sheet a corresponding number in the
                   same color field.  The white die a wild color and can be
                   used in place of any other color.
                3. The active player puts **all dice that show a lower value**
                   than the currently selected die on the silver tray printed
                   in the box.  If a player picks the lowest value, no dice
                   are placed on the silver tray.  Dice on the silver tray
                   can no longer be used by the active player (*exception:
                   Additional Dice action*)
                4. With the remaining dice, the active player rolls a 2nd time.
                   They again choose a die, place in on a free dice field, and
                   enters its value in the matching color field on their game
                   sheet.  All dice that show a lower value than the selected
                   die again are placed on the silver platter.
                5. The active player then rolls a 3rd time and executes the
                   actions as described above 1 last time.  Then they place
                   **all remaining dice** not on their score sheet on the
                   silver platter.

                **Attention**:  If a player decides in the 1st or 2nd roll to
                take high dice, it may happen that there are no dice left for
                a reroll.  If this happens, the player simply performs fewer
                than 3 rolls.
          - name: Passive Players
            text: |
                Only after the active player has placed 3 dice on their game
                board or can no longer reroll because all remaining dice are on
                the silver platter do the other players get a turn.

                * All passive players now get the dice set aside on the silver
                  platter.
                      * Of these dice, each player can choose 1 die to use
                        to mark a space on their score sheet.
                      * All passive players choose simultaneously, and a die
                        can be chosen by multiple passive players.
                      * After each passive player has marked their chosen die,
                        the player to the left becomes the active player.  They
                        get all 6 dice and rolls and rerolls, as described
                        above.
    - name: The Score Sheet
      text: |
          The score sheet has 5 colored areas.  For each die, a player will
          mark 1 field or write 1 number in 1 space.
